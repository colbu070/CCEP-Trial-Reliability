%% This function calculates the correlation of input time-series signal and provides confidence intervals to indicate significance against r <= 0.

%  
%       [avg, confInt, r, stim_trials] = estimateCorConf(signal, trials, sim, numTrials);
%       signal =          mxn num, signal length for trials by total number of trials
%       trials =          nx1 cell, stimulation sites for each trial in signal
%                         Example may look like [LA1-LA2 LA1-LA2 LA1-LA2 LA2-LA3 LA2-LA3 LA3-LA4 ...]
%       sim =             positive integer value, number of simulations to run in bootstrap
%       numTrials =       positive integer value > 2, number of trials to correlate for each stimulation site
%
%   Returns:
%       avg =             kx1 double, mean Pearson's correlation value for k stimulation sites
%       confInt =         kx2 double, confidence interval for mean for k stimulation sites
%       r =               kxt double, pairwise correlation values for all combinations t for the number of trials specified in numTrials for k stimulation sites
%       stim_trials =     kx2 cell, names of k stimulation sites in first column, number of trials for each site in second
